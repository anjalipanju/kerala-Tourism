    <h2>KOLLAM</h2>
    <p>One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is the centre of the countryâ€™s cashew trading and processing industry. Extolled by Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing terms, this was once a famous port of international spice trade. This ancient seaport is renowned for its coir manufacturing and cashew processing industries as well. This historic town is home to the celebrated Ashtamudi Lake, making it a gateway to the breath-taking backwaters of Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha is the longest and most enchanting experience on the backwaters of Kerala. With palm fringed waterways, historical treasures, exclusive cultural, biological and geological diversities, the district never fails to contribute the best travel experience.
